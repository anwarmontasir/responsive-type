    <p><strong>“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”</strong> is an English-language pangram—a sentence that
        contains all of the letters of the alphabet. It is commonly used for touch-typing practice, testing typewriters
        and computer keyboards, displaying examples of fonts, and other applications involving text where the use of
        all letters in the alphabet is desired. Owing to its brevity and coherence, it has become widely known.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The earliest known appearance of the phrase is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Journal"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Boston Journal</em></a>. In an article titled “Current
        Notes” in the February 10, 1885 morning edition, the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for
        writing students: “A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it
        contains every letter of the alphabet: ‘A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.’” Dozens of other newspapers
        published the phrase over the next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with “A” rather
        than “The”. The earliest known use of the phrase in its modern form (starting with “The”) is from the 1888 book
        <em>Illustrative Shorthand</em> by Linda Bronson.</p>
    <h3>Typing Practice</h3>
    <p>As the use of typewriters grew in the late 19th century, the phrase began appearing in typing lesson books as a
        practice sentence. Early examples include <em>How to Become Expert in Typewriting: A Complete Instructor
            Designed Especially for the Remington Typewriter</em> (1890), and <em>Typewriting Instructor and
            Stenographer's Hand-book</em> (1892). By the turn of the 20th century, the phrase had become widely known.
        In the January 10, 1903, issue of <em>Pitman's Phonetic Journal</em>, it is referred to as “the well known
        memorized typing line embracing all the letters of the alphabet”. Robert Baden-Powell's book <em>Scouting for
            Boys</em> (1908) uses the phrase as a practice sentence for signaling.</p>
    <p>During the 20th century, technicians tested typewriters and teleprinters by typing the sentence.</p>
    <h3>In Popular Culture</h3>
    <p>The first message sent on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow%E2%80%93Washington_hotline" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Moscow–Washington hotline</a> on August 30, 1963 was the test phrase “THE QUICK
        BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG'S BACK 1234567890”. Later, during testing, the Russian translators sent a
        message asking their American counterparts “What does it mean when your people say ‘The quick brown fox jumped
        over the lazy dog?’”</p>
    <p>A video on YouTube which captured a real occurrence of the pangram gained considerable popularity.</p>
    <h2>Computer Usage</h2>
    <p>In the age of computers, this pangram is commonly used to display font samples and for testing computer
        keyboards. In cryptography, it is commonly used as a test vector for hash and encryption algorithms to verify
        their implementation, as well as to ensure alphabetic character set compatibility. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Word</a> has a command to auto-type the sentence, in
        versions up to Word 2003, using the command <strong>=rand()</strong>, and in Microsoft Office Word 2007 and
        later using the command <strong>=rand.old()</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Cultural References</h2>
    <p>Numerous passing references to the phrase have occurred in movies, television, books, video games, advertising,
        websites, and graphic arts.</p>
    <p>The lipogrammatic novel <em>Ella Minnow Pea</em> by Mark Dunn is built entirely around the “Quick Brown Fox”
        pangram and its inventor. It depicts a fictional country off the South Carolina coast that idealizes the
        pangram, chronicling the effects on literature and social structure as various letters are banned from daily
        use by government dictum.</p>
